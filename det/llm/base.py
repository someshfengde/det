"""
This module defines the BaseLLMClient class, serving as an interface for interactions with
various Large Language Models (LLMs). It establishes a standardized method for generating text
responses across different LLM providers, ensuring flexibility and extendability in integrating
multiple LLM services.

By implementing the `generate_response` method, subclasses can provide specific functionalities
for any LLM provider, such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or others, adhering to a unified API.
This design promotes code reuse and simplifies the process of swapping or combining LLM services
in applications requiring natural language generation.

Example Usage:
--------------
class MyLLMClient(BaseLLMClient):
    def generate_response(self, prompt: str, **kwargs):
        # Implementation for a specific LLM provider
        pass

Implementing this interface allows for easy integration and maintenance of LLM-based features,
supporting a wide range of applications from chatbots to content generation tools.
